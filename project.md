Task Basics
Fields: Title, Description, Due Date (mandatory). Attachments & collaborators optional.
Components: Status, Deadline, Attachments, Comments, Subtasks, Collaborators.
Task Statuses
Unassigned, Ongoing, Under Review, Completed.
Under Review = work submitted & being reviewed by a collaborator (usually manager).
Assignment & Ownership
Staff auto-own tasks they create.
Assignment transfers ownership.
Managers/Directors can assign tasks to lower roles only.
Assignment = no accept/decline by staff, auto-added.
Subtasks
Must all be completed before parent task is marked complete.
Subtasks can have their own deadlines and appear in calendar.
Subtask collaborators must be a subset of task collaborators.
Editing & Updates
Staff can only edit tasks they created (title, due date, collaborators).
Status change ≠ edit (it’s an update).
Managers must be collaborators to update task status.
Deletion & Archiving
Tasks should not disappear permanently.
Archive/unarchive = not for first release.
Avoid deletion for first release.
Activity History
All task activity stored permanently.
Constraints
No recurring tasks.
No approval required for completion.
 
 
3. Task Grouping & Organization
 
Projects
Tasks can be standalone or belong to projects.
Projects have ownership but cannot be assigned.
Projects can have deadlines but no status (no % completion required).
Cannot delete projects that once contained tasks, even if empty.
Completed/deleted tasks inside project → project remains (for audit).
Collaborators
Project collaborators = superset; task collaborators = subset of project collaborators; subtask collaborators = subset of task collaborators.
All project task owners & collaborators are also collaborators of the project.
Team & Department
User belongs to one team (subset of a department).
Teams are within departments; departments = functional groups (e.g., Sales).
Project team = people in that project (not necessarily org chart team).
Visibility
Staff: see own tasks, teammates’ tasks, project tasks they’re in.
Manager: see team tasks.
Director: see department tasks.
HR/SM: see all tasks/projects.
